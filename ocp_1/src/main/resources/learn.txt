1. Access modifier table

private - access only in the same class

private package (default) -if the member is default can be access from:
                * same class
                * another class in the same package

protected - if the member is protected can be access from:
                * in the same class,
                * another class in the same package
                * subclass in a different package

public - everywhere

final - * variable cannot be changed
        * method cannot be overridden
        * class cannot be subclassed


2. Overloading and overriding

when multiple overloaded method are present, Java looks for the closest match follow by rules:
- exact match type
- matching a superclass type
- converting to a larger primitive type
- converting to an autoboxed type
- varargs

overriding rules:
- access modifier must be the same or more accessible
- return type must be the same or a more restrictive type (also known as covariant return type)
- if any CHECKED exception are thrown only the same or subclasses ot those exception are allowed to be thrown

3. instanceof

* cannot be called on classes which are not in relation (not extend one to another)
* null instanceof Object is false
* it is always allowed to call instanceof for interface even if class don't implement this interface


4. Virtual method invocation
    * calling method from exact type of class, not from parent class
    * don't care about fields - see example code
