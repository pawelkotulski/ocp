1. Access modifier table

private - access only in the same class

private package (default) -if the member is default can be access from:
                * same class
                * another class in the same package

protected - if the member is protected can be access from:
                * in the same class,
                * another class in the same package
                * subclass in a different package

public - everywhere

final - * variable cannot be changed
        * method cannot be overridden
        * class cannot be subclassed


2. Overloading and overriding

when multiple overloaded method are present, Java looks for the closest match follow by rules:
- exact match type
- matching a superclass type
- converting to a larger primitive type
- converting to an autoboxed type
- varargs

overriding rules:
- access modifier must be the same or more accessible
- return type must be the same or a more restrictive type (also known as covariant return type)
- if any CHECKED exception are thrown only the same or subclasses ot those exception are allowed to be thrown

3. instanceof

* cannot be called on classes which are not in relation (not extend one to another)
* null instanceof Object is false
* it is always allowed to call instanceof for interface even if class don't implement this interface


4. Virtual method invocation
    * calling method from exact type of class, not from parent class
    * don't care about fields - see example code

5. equals

The contract of equals

* reflexive - for non null reference values x, x.equals(x) should return true
* symetric - x.equals(y) return true and y.equals(x) return true
* transitive - x.equals(y) == true and x.equals(z) == true then z.equals(y) == true
* consistens - multiple invocation of x.equals(y) should always consistently return true or consistently return false
* for non null refference x x.equals(null) should return false

6. hashCode

The contract of hashCode

* within smae program result of hashCode for object should not change
* if equals return true for some two object, hashCode for this object should be the same - hash code should be calculated from subset of equals parameters
* if two objects are not equals they doesn't have to return different hashCode values, hashCode for this object can be the same

7. Enums

* in switch statement in case we cannot use enum class name with type ex:
case: Season.WINTER - will not compile
case: WINTER - will compile

* semicolon on end of declaration enums is optional only when there is only declaration of enum names!

* overriding methods in enums:

enum Season {
    WINTER, SUMMER,
    SPRING {
        public void printHours() {System.out.println("custom spring hours")}
    };

    public void printHours() { System.out.println("default season hours")}
}


7. Nested clases

Nested class - class within another class

* nested inner class - nested class which is not static
    - member - defined at the same level as instance variables
    - local - defined within a method
    - anonymus - defined within a method and doesn't have a name
* static nested class - defined at the same level as static variables


7.1 Member inner class
* can have be public, private, protected or default access modifier
* can extend and implement any interfaces
* can be abstract or final
* can access all members of the outer class including private members
* CANNOT declare static fields or methods

7.2 Local inner class
* dont have an access specifier
* cannot be declared static and cannot declare static fields or methods
* have access to all fields and methods of the enclosing class
* they don't have access to local variables of a method unless this variable is final or effectively final



EFFECTIVELY FINAL - if the code still compile with the keyword final inserted before local variable the variable is effectively final.

7.3 Anonymus inner class
